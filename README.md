Pulse Oximeter for Arduino & MATLAB
===================================

Description
-----------
This project is about incorporating the Arduino and MATLAB to record data from a homemade pulse oximeter.

Progress
--------
Currently the best way for data acquisition is to run the matlab pulse_oximeter file which will both program the arduino and acquire data to plot.
